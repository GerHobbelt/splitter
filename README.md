# jQuery Splitter

This is a fork of the forked copy from from http://methvin.com/splitter/

The original fork is at https://github.com/e1ven/jQuery-Splitter

The original forked copy restored jQuery 1.7 compatibility. But jQuery
1.9 removed `$.browser` therfore breaking the plugin.

This fork uses other means of browser detection to be compatible with
jQuery 1.9 and 1.10.

Apart from that, a few indentation changes and minor cleanup were
performed to make jslint a bit more happy.

I do not recommend to use this plugin for new projects. But legacy
projects, that already use jquery.splitter and want to update their
jQuery version may give it a shot.
